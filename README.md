# built-on-the-fly
A DnD 5e generator site with a focus on impromptu usability

I have 3 main goals for this project:
1. This site should be able to be used on-the-fly. That is: a DM should be able to click a button and instantly have access to information that they can use without having to think. 
2. The site should be improv-friendly. Generated content should have enough information to appear thought-out, but should leave room for improvisation on the DM's part.
3. The site should be persistent. A DM should be able to retrieve a randomly-generated object from last week's session.
